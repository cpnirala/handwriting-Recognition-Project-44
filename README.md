Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient handwriting recognition system capable of identifying and converting handwritten text into digital formats. The system aims to achieve the following:

•	Accuracy: Achieve a character recognition accuracy rate of at least 95% across multiple  
 	       handwriting styles and languages.

•	Efficiency: Process handwritten text at a speed of 20 pages per minute or faster, depending 
       on the hardware configuration.

•	Scalability: Support datasets exceeding 1 million samples, enabling adaptability for large-
         scale real-world applications.

•	Multi-language Support : Recognize and interpret at least 5 different languages with 
        distinct character sets, including English, Arabic, and Chinese.

•	Platform Independence : Design the system to be deployable on diverse platforms such as 
       mobile devices, desktop systems, and cloud services.

To achieve these goals, the project will utilize deep learning-based OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for feature extraction and sequence prediction, respectively.

4.2 Expected Outcomes:

Recognition performance benchmarked against popular datasets like IAM and MNIST, with word error rates (WER) below 10%.
A user-friendly application capable of processing real-world handwriting samples, including mixed-style inputs.
